# NaturalLanguageProcessing
This is my code notebook and support ticket text file for my NLP course from UT Austin's Postgraduate Certification in AI/ML: Business Applications.  In this project, I built a support ticket categorization system using AI that would categorize, tag, prioritize, and respond to customer technical support requests.
